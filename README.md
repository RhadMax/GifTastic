# GifTastic

This is a homework assignment given during the fourth week of class at the UCSD Extension full-time coding bootcamp. We have been introduced into using Ajax with the aid of jQuery to make requests for information from API's. In this instance we will be using the Giphy API to create a webpage where users can input text into a field and click a button that holds the text inputted when the button was made. When that button is then pressed it will request gifs from Giphy that contain the word or phrase entered for that button, and then populate those gifs onto the webpage. 

This exercise will help cement our knowledge of making API calls as well as the nuances of using the object notation we are returned to populate a webpage. It also may be a bit of fun seeing some silly memeworthy moments.
